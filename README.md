## Skills

### Software design and development

Heavily involved in the design and implementation of a series of highly modular RESTful APIs, build on <em>NodeJs</em>, with <em>Cassandra</em> and <em>Redis</em>, and deployed on <em>Amazon Web Services</em>. These apis interface with mobile, desktop and embedded clients to deliver the <em>Healthera</em> medicine system.

Developed an extensible system to interpret medicine information from pharmacy dispense labels, a key component of the <em>Healthera</em> offering.

Designed and implemented user interface tool chain on Raspberry Pi, to provide seamless and robust hardware input integration for a graphical client application.

Graduate of <em>Makers Academy</em>, a software development boot-camp, heavily focused on agile methodologies and test driven design. Completed the course as part of a team who developed a mobile-centred webapp, [Leftovers,](https://github.com/davidbebb/leftovers/blob/master/leftoversapp-nosound.mp4) using AngularJs and Firebase.

Designed a number of science exhibits for Cambridge Science Centre using a text based parametric python cad/cam library.


### Science outreach and presentation
Wrote and presented the initial set of Cambridge Science Centre science shows and workshops as Schools Co-ordinator. Many of these are still in frequent use.


### Organisation and event management	 

Organised Chain Reaction, a large engineering outreach event bringing together over 600 people to build a giant Rube-Goldberg machine in less than 6 hours.

Complete a pilot programme for a flagship outreach programme for Cambridge Science Centre.


### Interpersonal and teamwork 							
Maximised productivity and rapport between different groups of volunteers by monitoring and improving demonstrator well-being during the 2009 Cambridge Hands-On Science Summer Roadshow.

Guided training and development of novice archers as part of a novice development team within Cambridge University Bowmen.
